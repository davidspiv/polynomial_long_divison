## Purpose ##
Synthetic division of two polynomials and output the most simplified result including the remainder as a rational expression if needed.
## Input ##
Two separate inputs, one for the numerator and one for the denominator. For each, enter in the coefficients of the polynomial separated by spaces. If there is no term for that degree then use a 0. Only integers allowed.\
For example:\
2x^4 - 3x^2 + 5 would be entered as "2 0 -3 0 5"
## Output ##
Outputs the most simplified rational expression using LaTeX markup.
